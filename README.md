- Title: You May Better Reconstruct Anomalous over Normal Graphs: Analysis and a Simple Method for Reconstruction-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection
- Status: Submitted to NeurIPS 2024

## TL;DR

- One can reproduce the results of the main anomaly detection experiment with the below command
  ```
  python3 main.py -data dd -anom_type 0 -lr 0.001 -dim 256 -n_layers 4 -device cuda:0 
  ```

## Dataset

We support 10 graph benchmark datasets, whose overall statistics are as follows:
